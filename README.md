# Coin-Operated-Coffee-Machine
This project models a coin-operated coffee vending machine using Mealy and Moore finite state machines. It accepts ₹5 and ₹10 coins, dispenses coffee at ₹15, and returns change if needed, while comparing efficiency, state complexity, and output behavior of both models
